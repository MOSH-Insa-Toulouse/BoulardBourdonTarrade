## Installation
Use the Gerber folder to realise the Arduino Shield.  
Once you have it use the datasheet scheatics to solder all the component in place.  
Once the shield is complete plug it onto your Arduino Uno.  
Transfer the program into the arduino.  
Then you're good to go, you can start measuring with your sensor.
